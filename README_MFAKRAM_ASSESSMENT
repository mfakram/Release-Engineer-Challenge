Steps followed

(1) Fork the project: https://github.com/mfakram/Release-Engineer-Challenge
(2) Write dockerfile and submit to github
(3) Do Jenkins configurations at: http://18.224.30.246:8080/job/release_engineer_project/configure
      (A) Set the repository
      (B) Set the polling mechanism
      (C) Setup the Kubectl CLI: This did not work. The error was 
                “ERROR: No credentials defined to setup Kubernetes CLI”
(4) Setup the execute shell section that does the following:
   (A) After the clone, move to the project root where dockerfile is cloned
   (B) Build the image with name cox_akram:currentTimeStamp 
   (C) Push this image to the registry
   (D) apply Kubernetes deployment that has all configurations like pod name and environment variable

With this, with every change in version control, Jenkins will perform the build that will update the image and apply newly tagged image that is based on this submitted code.
